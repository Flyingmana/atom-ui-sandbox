# ui-sandbox package

You belong to the people thinking, the Atom Editor is not centred enough on UI?
Nice to meet you, I think the same. But UI is hard, especially with a system
with priority in only basic UI. So this package is to Experiment with the possibilities
and to try out Ideas you, I or anybody has.

For the rare cases, where people see something as usefull, we/I will extract it
into an own package to provide it as stable UI element for you.

You have an Idea, Wish or Crazy fantasy?
Tell us in the Issue section and we will start gather fairy dust to bring
it alive.

My crazy fantasy is, to have a touch friendly IDE.
